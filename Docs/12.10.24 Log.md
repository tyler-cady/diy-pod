Current plan is to create an mp3 player:

Criteria:
- Play music over headphones and bluetooth
- Play from both sd card and (when on wifi) Apple music API
- Run on a STM-32 based chip
	- Pi pico
	- Seeed studio
	- Maybe that photon 2 I have but it was pretty bad so idk
- Be written entirely in C and C++
- Custom feature limited kernel
- Have a GUI that looks something like the original ipod


Features for the kernel:
- Real-time scheduler:
	- Decoding
	- Display updates
	- Button inputs
- File system:
	- FAT32 (don't have to implement but boy that'd be cool)
		- Try thinFAT32
	- Read mp4s off sd card
- I2C driver for the OLED
- I2S or UART for the MP3 decoder
- GPIO for buttons / other peripherals

1. Write a bootloader to initialize the peripherals and set up the stack

2. Do the task manager/ scheduler
3. Hardware virtualization 
4. Audio playback 
	1. Decode audio with VS1053 decoder
